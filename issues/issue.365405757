@asker
I  can make a screen record video but you do not need it. Because you DO NOT
need it a red flag goes up that you may be a moron or an automatic chatbot.
This easily reproducible SEVERE PROBLEM applies to all chrome variants
brave, and  every other rebranded chromium source based browser. All you
need to do is follow the steps on android. By now google may be prosecuted
for criminal negligence and espionage against America's public.

@vaggasathish after reading your attempt to repro I cannot be sure why you think watching a video relates to UNABLE TO LOGIN TO GOOGLE. By the average-joe you must be a gravely disabled mind. You shouldn't really be participating in public settings.

During your wait for screen record video take a look at my logs of past reports I had to keep because buganizer kept deleting my bug reports. This here is actually about the 4th report of the same not fixed bug. The backlog is located here at github https://github.com/learningBASh/chromium-debug/issues/1 titled End Of Humanity bug. And take a good look at the YouTube channel connected to this bug. Because something surprising happened during my screen recording I suspect this bug is a JavaScript trap or hijacking of JavaScript running as the google.com domain. I can explain more please leave this report open so I can log it. Unrelated private info may have been captured on screen record and I should re-record to exclude the private info.

Actually when you look at my github issue containing all of the past reports indeed screenshots I supplied with typed labels and arrows in yellow overlayed on the screenshots -look these over as well as reading the full report. If you have any questions about the report do notbhesitate to ask and I will help you understand. If after reading the full history of these-this bug report if you still want a screen record say so.
 As you will see in the report this particular bug occored on older versions of chrome and do know it was also an entirely different version of android. The preponderance of evidence begins to point at quite possibly something to do with JavaScript -and further so because suddenly the bug SEEMS to have dissapeared what a surprise I find during my screen recording yet keep in mind the exact bug as I report DID insistently occour on this phone multiple times I reproduced it on this phone as it was reproduced multiple times on prior phone as may be seen in the GitHub log https://github.com/learningBASh/chromium-debug/issues/1 

I highly suspect this has to do with the way JavaScript interacts or should not interact with the login cookie of google.com. (but for any other site?) In order to check this out one would need a chrome browser with JavaScript debugging enabled. Can you reccomend a JavaScript debug version of chrome for use on my android?

While my months of tracking this bug is being looked over can you talk to your banker about how much you will value my report to earn paid rewards from bughunters.google.com .I see fivethousand for an XSS bug in Gmail and $31,837 rewarded for a Google Cloud Deployment bug. What do you and your banker and perhapse your attorney suppose this-here bug report should be worth considering this affects every google account security in the world and inhibits GDPR compliance but mostly is prosecutable by any of the public at large as either a civil damages or military espionage case. Which has been already commit by Google and confirmed by willful neglect to solve the bug. On the prosecution side giving away the security of entire accounts by willfull neglect is likely to value at bankruptcy of Google and further damages and injuries of Liberty against the public which google could not pay for. Wouldn't you say 51% shareholding of the entire Corporation is fair reward?

Continue to wait while I compare this regressiin from Chrome current stable with Chromium unstable latest. Again if you can point me to a JavaScript debugging webbrowser so the actual JS code given to the effected Chrome android browsers can be audited for code being involved in this SEVERE PRIVACY ISSUE.

The current preinstalled version of Chrome is 111.0.xxxx.116 and it seems to have different settings then latter versoins . This may actually be the browser version which this SEVERE PRIVACY ISSUE does regress to. I would need to be able to identify the changing of the handling of third party cookies in the sourcecode of Chrome to find out exactly how far this SEVERE PRIVACY ISSUE does regress. As you should know Google Play will force an upgrade to the latest Chrome from the playstore. That being said may explain why the bug wasn't reproduced while making a video in my previous post.
 Having compared the settings with Chromium unstable latest the part of the settings which differ are the handling of thirdparty cookies being not only in 'site settings' now also in settings > privacy > tracking. The span of the regression is now presumably from 130.0 - 111.0 the versiin may be updated in this bugreport to 130.0. Please update the version now.
 And do note the way the new handling of thirdparty cookies is put in settings seems to work hand in hand with the way JavaScript should-not be handling the login cookie. To take a look at the code which seems to have part in this offence I need access to a version of Chrome for android between the regressive versions 130-111 which does have JavaScript debugging.

I did supply a video. The effected browser is Chrome for android 130.0 - 111.0 For the affect of JavaScript I will need a JavaScript_debuggable Chrome for android build of the same.
 Your attempt to reproduce possibly is because you are already logged in with framework GPS. Be sure to remove google accounts from the device and maybe even disallow allow Google login setting in Chrome for android.  
However, the video is supplied watch the video which is a second proof of this bug having been reproduced multiple times. I previously did ask that you step aside and call for another bug handler to assist while you observe. Your earlier behavior shows that you are not fit for this- how I said unable to login to google and you equated that with watching a video- unfit.

I just noticed that you vaggasathis supplied a video and have seen you using chrome canary you wouldn't use canary but use stable. You would look at my video of the reproduced bug and enter the same settings if it is your goal to reproduce the bug.

For additional $1000 on top of my already qualifying for $500 bisect bonus for telling you this bug regresses to major release 111.0 I need to look at the commit tree for Google Chrome for android sourcecode. As per the bisect bonus rewards program: Bisect Bonus On top of the standard reward amounts, we offer a bisect bonus: $500: For identifying, such as through reproduction or other evidence, the earliest major release or oldest active release channel impacted by the vulnerability $1,000: For identifying the specific commit that introduced the bug
Where do I access the Google Chrome for android sourcecode commit archive repository?

You need to pay for some of this upfront so I can continue debugging. For this critical impact bug google rewards schedules only a modest 25,000 or more for something which would bankraupt Alphabet Inc. At least send the google branded test equipment a pixel phone and maybe a chromebook with google fi wireless service.  For about the fourth time WHERE DO I GET A JAVASCRIPT DEBUGGING CHROME FOR ANDROID BROWSER. Presumably this is Google proprietary build for developed by google product Chrome for android. How do you expect bughunters.google.com to work if you do not give me access to the tools necesarry to research this critical flaw.

Our free system of English law can adjourn civil courts to prosecute this. Aside from military prosecution, in civility this-here bug could cost Google's corporate customers unseen amounts in damages. And individuals privacy and safty may be at risk. Google's potential for liability may be higher than you would imagine.
 Let me be clear, in terms of civil rights and privacy military is obliged to protect the rights of any American who complains- willfully subverting the rights of American's should result in a class action bankraupcy and liquidation of the entire corporation and not only for funds in terms of restitution of offences against a priceless blessing yet to cease operation of the offender. Google has claimed to be an American multi-national company the American's involved are guilty of treason by supporting foreign espionage with the multinational elements. TikTok is under investigation now for foreign espionage against America's public. Google is not above the law. If Google were American Google should know better.
 You could wonder if Google is making the bugs then feeding the bugs to a select group in a sort of money laundering scheme against the shareholders of Alphabet Inc.; Why wouldn't Google pay me for the qualified child-issue bug report?
 I'll tell you what, since you didn't pay me for the lesser child-issue bug why should I debug the JavaScript which is likely involved in the same sort of scheme in which TikTok is now being liquidated for?  You need to pay me upfront.

I notice after my asking for PGP email Google has prepended the PGP key download with the emails. I shpuld get what about 35 honorable mentions ( underneath due-rewards ) on my bughunters profile just for talking.  It is mentioned over and over but I see no way to create a bughunter profile. How do you create a bughunters profile?

Two points for vaggasathish's Trainor. 1. Reports on canary and trunk are discouraged. Testers should target releases, stable and not jump to lesser supported builds. 2. Videos are discouraged as per bughunters. When I or any other reporter write everything out we do not need to incessantly insist on screenshots and videos to be attached.

Tracking down a vulnerability it takes time and dedication to get this far, and Google is learning about my discovery. I emailed the security team at security@google.com and get a reply as follows:

 *** IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ***
This e-mail address is not monitored by humans – if you do not fill out the form, we will not be able to see your report.

How does Google expect to receive PGP reports if none check the email?
va...@google.com <va...@google.com> #30Sep 23, 2024 03:11PM

Thanks for the updates.

PLease find the below observations

    We are able to REPRO the issue, only when we block javascript from site settings
    With javascript enabled, we are able to sign successfully
    Tracking protection: This setting is explicitly not seen under privacy and security, since feature not live yet
        We enabled flag (Tracking protection for 3PCD) to see tracking protection under settings
    With/without tracking protection & blocking all 3rd party cookies, with javascript being blocked we are seeing the issue.

    Video

This looks like intended , adding sign in owners bsazonov@ & triploblastic@ for the confirmation

Thanks

RE: "We are able to REPRO the issue, only when we block javascript from site settings"
 this suggests JavaScript is handling the login cookie. JavaScript perhapse should-not be handling the login credentials. It may be a JS exploit. I would need a JS_debug brower on android to debug this.
 Further, if and because it only happens when JS whitelists [*.]google.com also suggest possibility of extra-domain (thirdparty) JS code [is/were] handling the login although should-not. This also can be investigated only by JS_debug.
JavaScript is more exploitable than all of the code of the browser itself. The flaw in the app may be working hand-in-hand with a Google server-side and user side JS exploit which mishandles login credentials.
 I would prefer to be paid upfront to debug this myself and maintain full credit for the enirety of this complex and malicious privacy flaw. And to keep full credit to myself: Sovereign Jason M. Christos the First, for the full scope of the entire flaw as complex as it appears to be starting at security options UI in Chrome for android browser all the way into Google server side JS. Please let me know if Google can provide means of debugging JS using actual Chrome for android releases. Using alternate browsers or spoofing the UA may not always reproduce a bug as it effects to target specific software: Google Chrome for android production releases. Please let me know if Google can provide means of debugging JavaScript.

Also note I have bisected regression to a major release version of 111.0 and this bug may behave differently on various releae versions; as with the privacy & tracking settings allowing for tracking in sections of the menu buried levels deep which I now notice may have been changed. For doubling the bisect bonus I will continue to seek resources for bisecting this severe privacy flaw to a specific commit in the sourcecode of Chrome for android. Please let me know if Google can provide resources to do so: so as to not rely on thirdparty tools in order to debug.

Re: "With javascript enabled, we are able to sign successfully"
this suggests thirdparty handling of login credentials- itbshould-not be so. JS debug needed as per my previous comment.

RE: "Tracking protection: This setting is explicitly not seen under privacy and security, since feature not live yet"
No the feature is live and part of the problem. My very-initial bugreport was titled no cookie whitelist because this feature removed the option. These are multiple repros on live Google Chrome for android releases.

RE: "With/without tracking protection & blocking all 3rd party cookies, with javascript being blocked we are seeing the issue." you "we" do not appear to be able to follow instructions. I have already provided clear and simple reproduction steps and even provided a (unnecessary) screen recording which shows exactly what I have written out. Further I myself have reproduced it on multiple versions and phones with the prior reproduction having screenshots overlayed in yellow captions of the bug.
THE BUG IS CONFIRMED MULTIPLE TIMES REPRODUCIBLE AND AFFECTING ALL CHROME FOR ANDROID BROWSERS SINCE THE FLAW WAS INTRODUCED AFTER MY BISECT OF REGRESSION TO CHROME 111.0

IF THIS IS INTENTENDED IT IS CRIMINAL

This is the second video you have produced after refusing to be corrected- continuing on in your same error.
 For the second time. YOU SHOULD NOT BE USING CANARY. Canary is not a production release.
 For the second time vaggasathish your behavior is not fit for interaction. You need to call for help this report needs another handler.
