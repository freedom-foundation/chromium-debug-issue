Summary: Security documentation vulnerability child of 366515415 critical impact global security flaw

Steps to reproduce:
  1. Navigate to Google help for Chrome for android
  2. See Security documentation vulnerability put's the user in a vulnerable state
  3. Read my full bug report imcluding a succinct proof of concept
Important: The accounts and information of all Google users is affected when using Chrome for android production releases.

Browser/OS: Google server side security documentation
 

Attack scenario:
Security documentation vulnerability child of 366515415 critical impact global security flaw


Issue 366515415 child 1269738907 (IMMEDIATLY HALT "Tracking protection test group") re-issue because it was falsely marked "infeasible" and here added a succinct proof of concept along with the backlog of the original report please read through to the last comment rebuttle of the "infeasible" status because it was not responded to.

PROOF OF CONCEPT
Sovereign Jason M. Christos the First SP created succinct Security documentation vulnerability proof of concept: The user desires to disallow all third party tracking so as to keep the user's business with Google between Google and the user only ( As have I). In order to do so the user will block any and all third party tracking mechanisms such as cookies. The user may look into the documentation which as of the time of discovery of this bug until the time of reporting of this bug does not reflect the way to disable thirdparty cookies in any production release of Google Chrome for android. Sometime after the discovery and complaint of this critical impact security documentation bug , after only, was the security documentation updated to include as an extra note, on top of uncorrect instructions for disabling thirdparty cookies, any notice of the change in the security instrumentation of Chrome for android. Even as of currently reporting this bug the security settings documentation is still wrong. The user may have to change settings before figuring it out and meanwhile incurr thirdparty cookies which will not cease and desist tracking the unwilling-user. Thirdparty and even standard webcookies have little to no use outside of tracking the user. (infact the user may need to block any and all cookies and only whitelist [*.]google.com however Chrome no longer features a cookie whitlist) The proof of concept and even confirmed experience here is that the wrong security documentation will put the user in a vulnerable state by forcing the user to get thirdparty cookies during trial and error attempts to figure out how the security settings actually work , and after being confused by wrong documentation, during errors of trial and error the user is bound to get thirdparty cookies and furthermore in tandem with the upstream parent bug ( https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/365405757 ) as I have experienced and reproduced on video, in tandem with this open, confirmed, accepted, and ongoing bug the user is forced to either enable thirdparty cookies or not be able to login to google.com alltogether thus also being vulnerable by a denial of service: the choice is left to either have no-service ( cannot login) or take thirdparty tracking cookies.
IMMEDIATLY HALT "Tracking protection test group"

"The United States of America." Vs. Google (class action) SEVERE PRIVACY ISSUE cookie management is broken from Chrome 111.0 onward towards Chromium unstable current 130.0. It appears after ignoring 4 of my bugbreports they at Google are retroactively calling this severe privacy FLAW a "Tracking protection test group" however this flaw is a SEVERly wrong developement in the sourcecode from 111.0 onwards (bisect reward). Every chrome browser has this flaw there is no group (deceptive language). Screenshot attached of Google only recently adding notes abput a "test group" after I had already reported and documented this [Security documentation vulnerability] FLAW on github whilst Chrome 122 was current stable. Payment for this bug is most definitly in order. And for the people IMMEDIATLY HALT "Tracking protection test group" to prevent further criminal negligence liability for damages done by Google.

The child of a critical impact global security flaw here is a lie of retroactively covering up the flaw in the documentation by calling it a test group. I have attached the screenshot of the documentation which does put the user in a vulnerable position. This alone as a child issiue is worth $500 as per the program rewards as follows Documentation update (security impacting)       $100-$500       Standard amount for reports of incorrect documentation which is likely to lead to insecure states for users.
 Proof that this test group was not in the documentation prior to my bugreport may be seen in my backlog of previous bug reports where I may have complained of my help requests being frozen after saying Google support documentation eas WRONG.
 Payment of $100-500 for this alone is in order and $500 because it cannot get any more SEVERE then critical impact global vulnerability. $500

@Reporter: Could you please elaborate on the same by providing expected/actual behaviour along with the clear reproducible steps. If possible provide a screencast for better understanding/triaging the issue.
Also provide OS and Version details

Thanks..!

Yes I can provide expected/actual behaviour along with the clear reproducible steps and to be clear this here issue is a child of issue 365405757. This is about documentation putting the user in a vulnerable state. In this case by completely NOT documenting how to block thirdparty cookies as I confirmed during Chrome for android release 122.0 and mentioned on Google help community post dated Mar 13, 2024 3/13/2024, 5:50:42 PM as following with an excerpt:
""Here are the docs on the various ways to manage cookies " is exactly, exactly!, what I was talking about in my community post here https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/263788579?hl=en I do quote Myself " The BUG really proves Google Help files WRONG about block third-party cookies " with 3 updates and two replys missing (missing from the community post thread because of censorship). "
 You see here that I have confirmed on the date Mar 13, 2024 3/13/2024, 5:50:42 PM that Google Chrome for android documentation put's the user in a vulnerable state. And as for the so called "tracking protection test group" the parent Bug of this documentation bug proves that there is no test group but that this was inserted into the ducumentation later apparently as a coverup since I discovered the faulty documentation and parent bug.
 One would expect Google Chrome documentation to reflect the settings of the Google Chrome for android browser. However I have documented that from my date of reporting Google had only documentation relevent to browsers 111.0 before the regression of the parent bug. Thus putting the user in a vulnerable state -having no warning of the changes in the handling of third party cookies, and no correct documentation of how to block thirdparty cookies. Yet the only way to login to google.com is to allow third party cookies which is a FLAW and no test group because the flaw exists on all Chrome for android browsers after 111.0.
The actual behavior of the documentation is to show irrelivent old documentation and only after my initial report then insert a lie tagged "Important:" and "NOTE:" to attempt to explain away the missing documemtation as a "tracking test group" however the documentation seen only applies to browsers 111.0 and prior which are Unsupported by Google not even to be considered products of Google. Thus having put the user in a vulnerable state. Now showing the block thirdparty cookies setting in a  falsely labled "tracking protection test group" which is contingent upon the parent bug flaw in which when the user chooses to block thirdparty cookies the user will no longer be able to login to www.google.com.
 You should expect to see documentation which applies to current supported Google Chrome for android and not leaving the user in a vulnerable state.

If you were to disqualify my bug for any business security embargo (because of my github copies) know that "Liberty is a priceless blessing" andnit behoovethed me to keep a journal of Google's failuresbtobacknowledge and amendnit's errors. The upstream of this bug is certainly prosecutable as military espionage weather direct or indirect treason and/or multinational foreign espionage by now confirmed and documented willfull neglect to acknowledge a known and reproduced bug which has critical impact User information disclosure. Liberty is priceless and no settlement amount can pay restitution for injured liberty.
Any cooperation will speak good of your demeanor before the military tribunal. This is a now documented Security documentation vulnerability which put's the user in a vulnerable state according to Google rewards schedule is worth $500 now consider the impending liabilities of the upstream parent bug and Reassessment of Reward Amount is in order for this specific case; a Google pixel with Google wireless service should be accepted by me for reward of this child bug only- for our mutual benifit so I can with the equipment continue to hunt and solve this upstream parent bug here https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/366590749 .  The equipment will also help to mitigate this blocker bug here https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/366590749 which bug is likely an unknown parent or another child bug in where Google Chrome for android software is completely unusable and unworthy to be sold or on the market.
There is nothing " infeasible" ( Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) ) about this bug. This is already documented it is even on your records formentioned by myself here https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/263788579?hl=en there is still a frozen community help post where I initially complained of WRONG documentation which may be subpoenaed as evidence pursuant complicant espionage now confirmed by willful neglect there can be no excuse of accidental violation of the civil rights because Google has been notified yet continues. Individuals may invoke the fivth clause of the first amendment however corporations cannot neither should Alphabet Inc.'s documents escape siezure.
